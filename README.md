# author_of_the_quixote
Don Quixote by Cervantes is widely regarded as the first modern novel.
It tells the adventures of a mis-guided wannabe knight of the Spainish Kingdom in the 17th century.

'Pierre Menard author of the quixote' is a short story written by Jorge Luis Borges. 
It tells the fictional story of a 20th century author Pierre Menard and his quest to re-write Don Quixote but from his 19th century prespective.
Menard doesn't simply want to copy Cervantes' "Don Quixote."  - anyone can reproduce text through transcription. 
Menard's challenge is far more profound: to produce "Don Quixote" through his own creative process and perspective.
Menard lives in the 20th century, a time vastly different from Cervantes' 17th century. The historical, cultural, philosophical, and literary contexts are entirely different. 
Menard immerses himself in these modern contexts while aiming to write the same text Cervantes did, making his endeavour not just a feat of memory or replication but of profound creative and intellectual exercise.

The aim of this project called 'my laptop author of the quixote' is to train a generative AI program to produce "Don Quixote" through it's own process and perspective.
